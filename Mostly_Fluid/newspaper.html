			  <h2>The series is not just about my duel with De Villiers: Kohli</h2>
			  <p>
			  <b>CAPE TOWN:</b> He has the highest regards for his Royal Challengers Bangalore teammate and 
			  Indian skipper Virat Kohli simply does not understand why every Indo-South Africa series 
			  to be billed as a battle between him and AB de Villiers.<br><br>
			  
			  <img src="virat.jpg" alt="virat kohli image" /><br><br>
			  
			 <a><b>ALSO READ:</b> We are ready for South Africa, says Kohli</a><br><br>
			 
			"It's not like only two guys are playing in this series. AB is a great friend of mine. 
			I respect the way he plays the game and I have always respected him as a person as well. 
			But, when we are playing against each other -- it's not that we cross the line with each other, 
			we are just not like that," Kohli said when asked about his duel with the premier Proteas batsman.</p>
			<p>Kohli also reminded that merely getting De Villiers out won't ensure a Test match victory for India.
